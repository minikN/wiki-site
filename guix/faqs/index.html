<h2><a id="what-is-gnu-guix" class="anchor" href="#what-is-gnu-guix">¶</a>What is GNU Guix?</h2><p>GNU Guix (or simply Guix) is a liberating, dependable, and hackable
GNU/Linux distro configured using Guile Scheme. It is liberating
because by default it uses only free software, and the Linux libre
kernel. It is dependable because it is reproducable, supports
rollbacks through "generations," and has transactional upgrades (as
well as much more), and is hackable because it has Guile Scheme APIs
for the entire system and packages.
</p>

<p>More practically, this means that Guix is configurable in your
dotfiles (your GNU/Linux preferences, nicknamed dotfiles because they
often start with a period) and are reproducable on all your
machines. Your configuration can be copied across them all, and kept
in version control (such as git).
</p>

<h2><a id="should-i-use-the-package-manager-or-the-os" class="anchor" href="#should-i-use-the-package-manager-or-the-os">¶</a>Should I use the package manager or the OS?</h2><p>You can install Guix either as an OS or as a package manager in a
foreign distribution of GNU/Linux. There are benefits to both, however
if you truly want to reap all the benefits of Guix, you should use it
as an OS. The choice is up to you.
</p>

<h2><a id="how-do-i-install-guix" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-install-guix">¶</a>How do I install Guix?</h2><p>If installing as a package manager, Guix can be downloaded as a binary
from the official website at <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/download">guix.gnu.org</a>, from your distro's package
repositories, or using the <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/plain/etc/guix-install.sh">shell installer script</a>.
</p>

<p>If installing as an OS, you can go back to the System Crafters main
wiki page for GNU Guix to see the options between nonguix and normal
installation.
</p>

<h2><a id="but-how-do-i-work-with-only-free-software" class="anchor" href="#but-how-do-i-work-with-only-free-software">¶</a>But how do I work with only free software?</h2><p>Well, you find alternatives! The FSF has a great article about this
(written specifically for the COVID-19 pandemic, but always
applicable): <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/better-than-zoom-try-these-free-software-tools-for-staying-in-touch">free software alternatives</a>. For other general things,
consider LibreOffice for Microsoft Office, Gimp for Photoshop,
Inkscape for Illustrator, and there are many other good alternatives
to look for that respect your freedom.
</p>

<p>That said, we all have programs that we need for work that aren't free
(and if you don't, consider yourself lucky.) Guix System, the name for
the OS version, has options for nonfree software, such as nonguix,
Nix, and Flatpak.
</p>

<h2><a id="what-is-a-declarative-configuration" class="anchor" href="#what-is-a-declarative-configuration">¶</a>What is a declarative configuration?</h2><p>A declarative configuration is, put simply, when you write out your
settings and packages instead of running a command. This allows for
reproducibility, and easier management of installed packages. Think of
it as declaring what you are going to do before doing it, as opposed
to doing it without writing it down or alerting people.
</p>

<h2><a id="what-are-the-differences-between-guix-and-nix" class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-differences-between-guix-and-nix">¶</a>What are the differences between Guix and Nix?</h2><p>First and foremost, Guix is configured in Guile Scheme, a Scheme
(which in itself is a Lisp), while Nix is configured in... Nix. A bit
confusing :smile:. Guile Scheme is a full fledged Scheme programming
language, which means you can do some powerful things in it. Packages
as well as system configurations are written in Guile in Guix. Guile
also has more unified commands, while Nix has many for different
purposes.

<h2><a id="im-stuck-where-do-i-ask-for-help" class="anchor" href="#im-stuck-where-do-i-ask-for-help">¶</a>I'm stuck! Where do I ask for help?</h2><p>Check out one of the System Crafters channels on Discord, IRC, and
Matrix. You can also watch some of the System Crafters videos, read
this wiki, or ask in <kbd>#guix</kbd> for free and <kbd>#nonguix</kbd> for nonfree on <a href="https://libera.chat">Libera.Chat</a>
IRC.
